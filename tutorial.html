             <p>Candlesticks give you an instant snapshot of whether a market’s price movement was positive or negative, and to what degree. The timeframe represented in a candlestick can vary widely. Coinbase Pro, for instance, defaults to six hours — with each candle representing a five-minute slice — but users can set it to be longer or shorter. (Also worth noting: unlike stock markets, crypto markets are open 24 hours a day. So the “open” and “close” prices are the prices at the beginning and end of the selected timeframe.)
                Candlesticks can reveal much more than just price movement over time. Experienced traders look for patterns in order to gauge market sentiment and to make predictions about where the market might be headed next.Understanding what candlesticks might mean in the context of a particular asset or within certain market conditions is one element of a trading strategy called technical analysis — by which investors attempt to use past price movements to identify trends and potential future opportunities. </p>

                   <img class="d-none d-lg-inline" src="lolli_icon.png" alt="">
                   <p class="lead">DCA is a long-term strategy, where an investor regularly buys smaller amounts of an asset over a period of time, no matter the price (for example, investing $100 in Bitcoin every month for a year, instead of $1,200 at once). Their DCA schedule may change over time and — depending on their goals — it can last just a few months or many years. 

                    Although DCA is a popular way to buy Bitcoin, it isn’t unique to crypto — traditional investors have been using this strategy for decades to weather stock market volatility. You may even use DCA already if you invest via your employer’s retirement plan every payday.

                   <h2>What is hosted wallet?</h2>
                    <img class="d-none d-lg-inline" src="lolli_icon.png" alt="">
                    <p class="lead">The most popular and easy-to-set-up crypto wallet is a hosted wallet. When you buy crypto using an app like Coinbase, your crypto is automatically held in a hosted wallet. It’s called hosted because a third party keeps your crypto for you, similar to how a bank keeps your money in a checking or savings account. You may have heard of people “losing their keys” or “losing their USB wallet” but with a hosted wallet you don’t have to worry about any of that.

                        The main benefit of keeping your crypto in a hosted wallet is if you forget your password, you won’t lose your crypto. A drawback to a hosted wallet is you can’t access everything crypto has to offer. However, that may change as hosted wallets start to support more features.

                     <h2>What is NFT?</h2>
                      <p class="lead">Non fungible Tokens can be understood as basic digital assets, which are ‘copies’ of real or tangible objects or instances. They can be sold or bought between two parties online, and they come encoded with the same infrastructure that runs and powers cryptocurrencies – blockchain.

                        For instance, NFT art is a specific digital copy of real art that people can buy or sell. Whoever buys it now owns this specific copy of the art, even though the original artist or owner will still have the creator’s rights.
                        
                        This same idea can be applied to music, videos, or even in-game virtual items. So, for people who see a non fungible token merely as crypto art or NFT art, it’s much more than that.
