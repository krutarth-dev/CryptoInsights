             <h1 class="">What is crypto currency?</h1>
             <p>Cryptocurrency is a relatively new type of money that operates in a completely different way than the traditional currency we all use every day. The most basic difference is that it’s exclusively a virtual currency, meaning there are no physical cryptocurrency coins or notes you can keep in your back pocket.

                It’s also issued, or created, in a unique way. Instead of being produced by a central bank or government, like U.S. dollars, euros and other fiat currencies are, new cryptocurrency units typically enter circulation through a technological process that involves the participation of volunteers from all over the world using their computers.
                
                That is why cryptocurrency is often described as “decentralized.” Cryptocurrencies are typically not controlled or operated by any single entity in any single country. It takes an entire network of volunteers from around the world to secure and validate transactions made with cryptocurrency.</p>

                   <p class="lead">Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
                    Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members.

                    <p class="lead">Bitcoin mining is a lot like running a big data center. Companies purchase the mining hardware and pay for the electricity required to keep it running (and cool). For this to be profitable, the value of the earned coins has to be higher than the cost to mine those coins.Beyond releasing new coins into circulation, mining is central to Bitcoin’s (and many other cryptocurrencies’) security. It verifies and secures the blockchain, which allows cryptocurrencies to function as a peer-to-peer decentralized network without any need for oversight from a third party. And it creates the incentive for miners to contribute their computing power to the network.

                     <h2>Taxes on cryptocurrency in India</h2>
                      <p class="lead">Cryptocurrency has just become a popular notion in India. Since the Covid-19 outbreak hit the country, sending the economy into a downward spin, Indians have begun to rely on cryptocurrency investments in the hopes of reaping excellent returns.

                        Many Indians profited from digital tokens as a result of the Bitcoin rally in 2020 and the unanticipated Shiba Inu price surge in 2021.
                        
                        Despite its growing popularity and usage, bitcoin laws were desperately needed. Even though the central government had proposed plans, none have yet been implemented. In the wake of reports that India will implement a complete ban on virtual assets, the government has decided to levy a 30% tax on cryptocurrency.
                        
                        Fortunately, the cryptocurrencies have not been banned and instead a large 30% tax has been imposed on sale of digital assets income.
